! Industry Background

Benjamin West is a purchasing agent focused exclusively on serving the hospitality industry. While our day-to-day work is very focused on the provision of procurement services for new and existing hotel properties, it is important not to forget that we are part of an extremely large, global industry that involves many companies, consultancies, brands, and customers, all of whom can affect our business in tangible ways (not to mention the impact of secondary industries like travel, aviation, and construction; or economic, trade, and policy decisions.)

For now, we will focus on providing a fundamental understanding of the hospitality industry itself. As described above, there are many (many) secondary and tertiary "players" in this industry, and it's impossible to name even all of the primary "players" that affect our business. Ultimately, however, our day-to-day business is driven by the decisions of members of the following groups.
# Real Estate & Hotel Owners
# Hotel brands
# Hotel Designers

!! Hospitality Industry

!! Purchasing Industry & Competitors

!! Manufacturing

!! FF&E vs OS&E

It's important to understand the difference between FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment) and OS&E (Operating Supplies & Equipment). The difference between the two categories is significant not because of the types of products being purchased, but because of the financial and accounting differences between the two:

* FF&E is considered an asset. It has depreciating value and exists on the hotel's balance sheet.
* OS&E is considered an operating cost. It impacts the hotel's income statement.
